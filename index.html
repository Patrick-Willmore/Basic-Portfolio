		<p>Greetings! Iâ€™m so glad you chose to visit my website, and see some of my recently developed HTML/CSS skills. As you can see from the heading, they call me Patrick Willmore, King of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Realm, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms- Just kidding. My background is in Finance, having worked for Fidelity Investments for 9 years, most recently as a Senior Trade Support Specialist. I currently hold Series 7, 9/10, 4, and 63 licenses. However, I am interested in a role in the software industry. At the moment, I am attending Coding Bootcamp at the University of Denver, a program that I will complete in April 2018. Please reach out if you would like to know more about me!</p><br>
		<p>As you can see, my name box is slightly offset from the heading line, which I admit is slightly different than the homework, but it was intentional because I like how it looks.</p>
